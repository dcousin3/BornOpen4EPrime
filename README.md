# BornOpen4EPrime

This repository contains a BornOpenData package that implements a protocole that runs within E-Prime 2.0.10.

The purpose is to render the process of putting data files publicly accessible totally automatic. Just put the package somewhere within your E-Prime experiment (from within E-Studio), specify the name of the online repository, its owner as well as the user name and password and that's it! At the end of the experiment, the participant's data will be uploaded to your online repository without additional manipulation.

The full report will be available soon.

If you find issues with the package, send a notification to Denis Cousineau.
